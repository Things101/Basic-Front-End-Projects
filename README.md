# HTML And CSS Projects

Utilized HTML and CSS to create two webpages. 

The first webpage is a brief summary of CSS basics from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS). It consist
of a brief introduction to the various features of CSS. There is a outline on the left side of the webpage allowing for easy access of the different main ideas.
Mobile viewing is supported.

The second webpage consist of a product page featuring three microsoft surface laptops. It uses more features of CSS compared to the first webpage. There is a
outline on the top of the screen for easy access to the three featured products. The button directly links the user to the microsoft site for that specific laptop.
Mobile viewing is supported.

## Future Plans

*Create new webpages with JS and various front end developmental libraries. This can include Bootstrap, React, Redux and jQuery.
*Create webpages with back end APIs. The framework I will work with is to be determined.
*Create a fullstack dynamic webpage using different technologies for the front-end and back-end side.
